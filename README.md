The idea for this game came to me because I love Christmas. It is currently the 5th of December as I am writing this, and I have already been listening to Christmas music and wearing my Christmas jumpers for weeks now. Let me ask you a question: what is your favourite Christmas movie that you watch every year, or your favourite Christmas song, or your favourite food you eat during this time? I can guarantee you have an answer to each of those questions (unless you don’t celebrate Christmas), but can you answer this: what is your favourite Christmas video game?

I noticed a lack of Christmas video games - I don’t think I can even name one. Despite this, gamers still get very excited about Christmas updates in games, such as the hype that surrounds Fortnite with each Christmas update, or the excitement you used to get when you loaded up GTA and the map was covered in snow.

At first, I thought this would be a bad idea for reasons such as the game being seasonal, meaning no one would likely play it outside of the winter months. Additionally, some religious groups might be against this game if they don’t believe in or celebrate Christmas. This could affect the ethics and social practices of me as the developer.

After thinking about this, I realised that the game isn’t tailored to those groups anyway, so they can simply choose not to play it. There are hundreds, if not thousands, of Christmas TV shows, movies, and books that portray Santa Claus, and millions of children believe in and enjoy this character.
